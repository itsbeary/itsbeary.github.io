            <p>since 2023.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I had first touched Java in 2017 but shortly quit after lack of motivation. In 2019, I had recontinued with Java.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had started learning MySQL when I needed a data solution for kealands.net since storing data in YAMLs wasn't the greatest idea.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I learnt Python to automate gambling in the game Rust since there was a exploit with the Gambling Wheel which got patched in the May 2023 Update</p>
